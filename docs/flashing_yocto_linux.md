# Flashing Yocto Linux

> On Windows, the Yocto [image can be programmed](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-documentation/blob/v2023.02/reference-designs-fpga-and-development-kits/updating-mpfs-kit.md) via `USBImager`.  
> For detailed documentation, please refer to [PolarFire SoC Documentation](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-documentation)

## Linux Image

Connect the USB to the J19 port on the FPGA.
Download and extract the [2023.02.1 Yocto image](https://github.com/polarfire-soc/meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp/releases/download/v2023.02.1/core-image-minimal-dev-mpfs-video-kit-20230328105837.rootfs.wic.gz), then program the extracted image, power-cycle the board, and ensure Yocto Linux boots (on MMUART1).

Linux images with a '.wic' or ".wic.gz" file extension use a GUID partition table (GPT) and are suitable for programming to the eMMC.
>Note: If you use an image generated with the PolarFire SoC Yocto BSP, extract it so it has the ".wic" extension. Do not program compressed images (i.e., those with the ".wic.gz" extension), as this can cause boot issues.

When updating a kit as shown in this section, keep the reference design and Linux image versions in sync by using the latest release assets.

## Programming a Linux Image

### eMMC

A PolarFire SoC kit's eMMC content is written by the Hart Software Services (HSS) using the `usbdmsc` command. The HSS `usbdmsc` command exposes the eMMC as a USB mass storage device through a USB-OTG connector.

If both QSPI and MMC services are enabled in the HSS, you must specify the default device to be programmed before running the `usbdmsc` command. For example, to program the eMMC using the USBDMSC service, you must enter the `mmc` command before running the `usbdmsc` command.

### eMMC Content Update Procedure

1. Connect the USB-UART connector to your host PC. This connection will give you access to the PolarFire SoC UARTs
2. Open a terminal application to interact with the HSS through MMUART0. Settings are 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, and no flow control
3. Power on the board, and the Microchip logo will be displayed on MMUART0 as the HSS boots
4. Press a key in the terminal application to stop the HSS from booting **(There is a very brief window in which to do this upon starting the board)**. This will give you access to the HSS command line interface, and a ">>" for input will be displayed in the terminal
5. Type `mmc` to select mmc as a boot source and then `usbdmsc` in the HSS command line interface. If successful, a message saying "Waiting for USB Host to connect" will be displayed
6. Connect the USB-OTG connector to your host PC. The eMMC content will be transferred to the kit through this connection
7. The eMMC should now appear as a mass storage device/drive on your host PC
8. Launch USBImager

9. Select the *Image file* you would like to program to the eMMC. Note: Linux images are generated with a timestamp; assets from different releases will have different names

10. Select the target *Device* to program the image to

11. Click *Write*

12. Once writing is complete, unmount/eject the drive from the host PC and press `CTRL+C` in the HSS command line interface. Disconnect the micro-USB cable from the USB-OTG connector
13. Type `boot` to boot the newly copied Linux image
14. HSS boot messages will appear on MMUART0, and the Linux boot will appear on MMUART1
